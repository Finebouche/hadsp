## 📍 Overview

HAG introduces an innovative, biologically-inspired approach to improve Reservoir Computing networks. Grounded in Hebbian plasticity principles, HAG dynamically constructs and optimizes reservoir architectures to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of time-series prediction and classification tasks. By autonomously forming and pruning connections between neurons based on Pearson correlation, HAG tailors reservoirs to the specific demands of each task, aligning with biological neural network principles and Cover’s theorem.
